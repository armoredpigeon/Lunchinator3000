# Lunchinator 3000

So... This is what I managed to get done before time ran out. It might have gone faster but before the Thanksgiving holiday I had one idea of how to structure things, and after I wanted to refactor to simplify the code. I hope what I have built shows that I'm able to do the job, even though it's not finished.
